# Understanding the MVC Pattern in Unity: An Inventory System Example

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a software design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components. Let's explore how this pattern is implemented in a Unity inventory system using the provided C# files.

## Model: InventoryModel.cs

The Model represents the data and business logic of the application.

```csharp
public class InventoryModel
{
    private List<ItemData> items = new List<ItemData>();

    public void AddItem(string name, int quantity) { ... }
    public void RemoveItem(string name, int quantity) { ... }
    public List<ItemData> GetItems() { ... }
}
```

Key features:
- Manages a list of inventory items
- Provides methods to add and remove items
- Encapsulates the data manipulation logic

## View: InventoryView.cs

The View is responsible for displaying the data to the user.

```csharp
public class InventoryView : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject itemPrefab;
    public Transform contentPanel;

    public void UpdateInventoryDisplay(List<ItemData> items) { ... }
}
```

Key features:
- Defines UI elements (itemPrefab, contentPanel)
- Updates the visual representation of the inventory

## Controller: InventoryController.cs

The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and View.

```csharp
public class InventoryController : MonoBehaviour
{
    private InventoryModel model;
    private InventoryView view;

    void Start() { ... }
    public void AddItem(string itemName, int quantity) { ... }
    public void RemoveItem(string itemName, int quantity) { ... }
    private void UpdateView() { ... }
}
```

Key features:
- Initializes and manages both Model and View
- Handles user input (e.g., adding/removing items)
- Updates the Model and refreshes the View

## How It Works Together

1. The Controller initializes the Model and View.
2. User actions (like adding an item) are received by the Controller.
3. The Controller updates the Model (e.g., adds an item to the inventory).
4. The Controller then calls UpdateView() to refresh the View.
5. The View requests the latest data from the Model through the Controller.
6. The View updates its display based on the new data.

This separation of concerns allows for easier maintenance, testing, and modification of each component independently.
